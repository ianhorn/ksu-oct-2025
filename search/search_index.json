Cloud Store A Cloud Store connection file is a method to crawl a cloud bucket/container like a regular folder. In some instances, these are required when connecting to STAC APIs. You can download a .ACS file from the AWS Explorer . To create your own, use the instructions below. In the Ribbon at the top, click on Insert, Connection, New Cloud Store Connection.

Also, on your own machines, you may right click on the either of the connections and choose to save to favorites and add to new projects. Explore the STAC In the map, zoom to and area of interest. For this example, I have zoomed to the area in western Kentucky south of Woodman in Pike County, Kentucky. Figure: Area of Interest, coal mine south of Woodman. *X* marks the spot.
